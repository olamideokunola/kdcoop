Installation 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Install The Sleuth Kit (see README for download locations).   This
   includes doing a 'make install' so that the executables and files
   are installed in a single directory.  Note that this does not 
   currently work natively on Windows.  It will work using Cygwin, but
   you must install and build The Sleuth Kit in Cygwin and not use the
   Win32 executables that are available on the sleuthkit.org website.

2. Untar the Autopsy file. 

3. Run 'make'.  It will try to locate the grep and strings utilities.
   If any are not found, it will prompt you for the location.  It will
   also search for the TSK installation. 

4. The install script will ask if you have the NIST National Software
   Reference Library (NSRL).  If you do, you will need to enter the
   path of it.  The NSRL is available from www.nsrl.nist.gov.
   
5. You will be prompted for the Evidence Locker location.  This is the
   base directory where all cases will be stored.  You must create this
   directory on your own.  


Live Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type 'make live' or run the 'make-live-cd' script to build the 'live-cd'
directory.  The 'live-cd' directory can be burned to a CD.
